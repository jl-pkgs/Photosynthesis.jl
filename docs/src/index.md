# Photosynthesis

A Farquhar-von-Cammerer-Berry (FvCB) photosynthesis model.

This module at its core is a rewrite of the Maespa/Maestra models in Julia. It
has been written to have a modular structure that can be easily modified or added
to at any level. It is also designed to itself be a component of larger
model.

It aims to provide a comprehensive yet minimalist set of photosynthesis and leaf
energy balance models, eventually including as many as possible published
photosynthesis formulations: but nothing else. Growth models, 3D canopy models,
nutrient uptake etc. should be supplied from another package. The code for these
from Masepas/Maestra has *intentionally* not been included to improve modularity
and reduce complexity.

Only parameters that are actually used must be specified, and all
parameters have sensible defaults.

Photosynthesis.jl uses a hierarchical structure of parameters that are composed
of modular pieces of functionality. They contain the variables the formulation
requires and also are dispatched to the methods specified for the formulation.

All sub-model choices are specified by selecting sub-model types, not `if`
blocks as is common in older models. This means that the set of used parameters
and functions is always known to the compiler, which may allow more automation
of sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation.
